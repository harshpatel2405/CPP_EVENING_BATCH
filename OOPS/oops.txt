OOPS  -- Object Oriented Programming Concepts 
real life solution of anything 



// structure  -- properties (data members)
struct Student
{
    // properties(data members)    
    int rno ;
    int age;
    int std;
    string name;
    string div;
};


// advanced structure -- properties , behaviour (methods /  member functions)
class Student{
     // properties(data members)
    int rno ;
    int age;
    int std;
    string name;
    string div;

    // behaviour(member function)
    void study()
    {

    }
    void play()
    {

    }
};


class are logical / not physical
objects are created ,  then memory is allocated..
objects can be physical as well as logical / not physical

ACCESS SPECIFIERS
-----------------

HOW MUCH ACCESS YOU WANT TO PROVIDE YOU NEED TO SPECIFY IT ......

Types:
------
1) private   ::: accessible only inside the class
2) public    ::: accessible everywhere throughout the file 
3) protected ::: accessible within class and another classes only (with the help of inheritance)
